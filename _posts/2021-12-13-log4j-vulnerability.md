## Apache Log4j is a Java-based logging utility.

Apache and Java have been around for a long time and are widely used.

##  "Zero-day software" was obtained by hacking into a developer's computer before release.

The time from when a software exploit first becomes active to the time when the number of vulnerable systems shrinks to insignificance is known as the window of vulnerability. The timeline for each software vulnerability is defined by the following main events:

    t0: The vulnerability is discovered (by anyone).
    t1a: A security patch is published (e.g., by the software vendor).
    t1b: An exploit becomes active.
    t2: Most vulnerable systems have applied the patch.
