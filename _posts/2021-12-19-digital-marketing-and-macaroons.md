Running a business can be a tough racket. Treating yourself and your clients to something special every once in a while is important, especially during such a rough last couple of years.

# Rule of primacy and declining return

"The 100th cookie definitely doesn't taste as good as the 1st."

Whether you are the first one to deliver that holiday gift, or the first one to write that incredible article or post about an upcoming topic - it pays off to bring quality to the table early (pun intended).

We purchased incredibly unique gifts from a local company Pangea. We had the chance to plan and build a new item with them (the gold-crested, mocha macaron - sounds like a bird). Not only are we supporting an organization who's product we believe in, we had the opportunity to learn more about their digital strategy and how Dark Matter could play a role in the future.

# Even in the age of COVID, in-person experiences are extremely important.
