As 2021 comes to a close, we can all breath a collective sigh of relief that, although tattered, we have made it through another year in a global pandemic. ***Don’t lose steam just yet though!*** Set yourself up right for 2022 by checking in, reaching out, and extending gratitude to clients that have kept your business afloat. But remember, authenticity and timing play a key role this holiday season.

Whether you are the first vendor to deliver that over-the-top fruit basket or the first person to send that cheeky handwritten card, it pays off to bring quality to the table early (pun intended).

This year at Dark Matter, we collaborated with local restaurant [Pangea](https://tastepangea.com/) to create custom, elegant macarons that surprised our clientele. In true Dark Matter fashion, the theme was black with a little pizazz. The macarons? Café Mocha Macarons with a 24k Gold detailing. Unique? Check. Budget-friendly? Absolutely. Client bellies? Full.

We spent Friday evening hand-delivering our delicious, swanky macarons to each one of clients and engaging in important conversations

#### We celebrated wins, mourned losses, and started looking ahead to the New Year.

## Mission accomplished.
